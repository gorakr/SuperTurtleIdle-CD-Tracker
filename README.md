## HOW TO USE:
Install a UserScript manager extension such as TamperMonkey and set to run on page visit  
[Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)  
etc.  

The first value for a timer can be set to 1 or 0 on the cd_timers object to enable or disable individual timers you want to see

Water timer shows the % value remaining on your least watered plant available. The border is yellow if you have at least 1 empty plot, red if all plots are empty
Dungeons borders are colored per remaining charge - green at 3, yellow at 2, red at 1, and black again when you have no charges left

If you unlock a new feature that is trackable and enabled it will appear on page refresh (remember to save your game!)

Original idea from @yawa on Super Turtle Idle Discord

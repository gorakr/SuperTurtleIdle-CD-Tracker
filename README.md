HOW TO USE:
Install a UserScript manager extension such as TamperMonkey (google it) and set to run on page visit

the first value for a timer can be set to 1 or 0 on the cd_timers object to enable or disable individual timers you want to see

water timer shows the % value remaining on least watered plant available plant the border is yellow if you have at least 1 empty plot, red if all plots are empty
dungeons borders are colored per remaining charge green at 3, yellow at 2, red at 1, and black again when you have no charges left

if you unlock a new feature that is trackable and enabled it will appear on page refresh (remember to save your game!)
